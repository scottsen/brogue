## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Current Development Phase (2026-04-17)

This doc was rewritten as part of the 2026-04-17 trust-restore audit. For the full audit, read `docs/PROJECT_REVIEW_2026-04-17.md`.

### Track A: Single-Player (playable, healthy)

The single-player roguelike is feature-complete and playable: mining, crafting, equipment, save/load, character classes, floor progression, Legacy Vault, Lua event system. Current test numbers:

- **1065 tests passing / 0 failing / 2 skipped** (suite of 1067 — collection clean, run clean, no hangs).
- MP async-cleanup and lock-reentrancy bugs closed in commit 33d72f7.

**Polish work in flight:**
- Playtesting and balance tuning
- Content expansion (more monsters, recipes)
- Tutorial system
- Lua advanced features (AI behaviors, actions)

### Track B: Multiplayer (experimental)

Earlier docs claimed "Phase 2 complete (2+ player co-op working)". That overstated reality. As of 2026-04-17:

- Core alignment between the MP server and the single-player action API was broken. `GameSession.process_action()` executed actions against a raw `GameState` instead of the `GameContext` the action API requires, the ActionOutcome API calls used old attribute names, and the disconnected-player fallback imported a `WaitAction` module that did not exist. **Repaired in commit 0449d66.**
- Subsequent pass (commit 33d72f7) fixed a non-reentrant-lock deadlock in `cleanup_expired_disconnections`, contradictory leave-game semantics, and two stale tests. **All MP server tests now pass (server suite: clean).**
- Treat multiplayer as experimental until the remaining async tests are green and a 30+ min co-op session has been validated end-to-end.

**For multiplayer design:** See `docs/design/MULTIPLAYER_DESIGN_2025.md`

## What is Veinborn?

**Veinborn = NetHack + SWG Mining + Multiplayer Co-op**

A mechanical roguelike where you dive into procedural dungeons, hunt for perfect ore spawns, craft legendary gear, and fight monsters. Think NetHack's tactical combat meets Star Wars Galaxies' resource hunting.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Tight mechanics over narrative
- "Git gud" difficulty
- Social play (bros playing together)
- Replayability through randomization

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Run the Game

```bash
# Easy way (recommended)
./veinborn

# Or install system-wide (then run from anywhere)
./install.sh
veinborn

# Advanced options
./veinborn --debug    # Debug logging
./veinborn --safe     # Terminal reset on crash
./veinborn --help     # Show help

# Old way (still works)
python3 run_textual.py
```

**Controls:**
- **Arrows / HJKL:** Move
- **YUBN:** Diagonal movement
- **R:** Restart game
- **Q:** Quit

### 2. Learn How to Play

👉 **[Read HOW_TO_PLAY.md](../HOW_TO_PLAY.md)** - Complete 5-minute guide!

**Quick Start:**
- Move with arrow keys or `HJKL`
- Bump into monsters to attack (`g` = goblin, `o` = orc, `T` = troll)
- Press `s` next to ore veins (◆) to survey properties
- Press `m` to mine ore (takes 3-5 turns, you're vulnerable!)
- Find forges, press `c` to craft equipment
- Press `e` to equip crafted gear
- Watch your HP in the status bar
- Die and learn (it's a roguelike!)

**The guide covers:**
- Complete controls reference
- Your first game step-by-step
- Mining & crafting strategies
- Character classes explained
- Common mistakes to avoid

### 3. Explore the Code

**Core game loop:** `src/core/game.py`
```python
# Main game loop (simplified)
while player.is_alive:
    player_action = get_input()
    process_action(player_action)
    monsters_take_turns()
    update_display()
```

**Map generation:** `src/core/world.py`
```python
# BSP dungeon algorithm
def generate_dungeon():
    partition_space()  # Binary Space Partitioning
    create_rooms()
    connect_rooms()
    spawn_monsters()
```

**UI rendering:** `src/ui/textual/app.py`
- Uses Textual framework (terminal UI)
- Widgets: map, status bar, sidebar, message log
- Refreshes on player action

## Understanding the Code

### Game State Architecture

```python
# Everything lives in GameState
class GameState:
    player: Player
    monsters: list[Monster]
    map: Map
    message_log: list[str]
    turn_count: int
```

**Simple and direct** - No event bus, no NATS, no complexity (yet!)
- Phase 1 (MVP): Direct function calls
- Phase 2 (Multiplayer): Refactor to event-driven architecture

### Core Game Loop

```python
# src/core/game.py (simplified)
def run_game():
    state = GameState()
    state.map = generate_dungeon()
    state.player = spawn_player()
    state.monsters = spawn_monsters()

    while state.player.is_alive:
        # 1. Player acts
        action = get_player_input()
        process_player_action(state, action)

        # 2. Monsters act
        for monster in state.monsters:
            monster_ai(state, monster)

        # 3. Update display
        render(state)
```

### Map Generation (BSP Algorithm)

```python
# src/core/world.py (concept)
def generate_dungeon(width, height):
    # 1. Binary Space Partitioning
    root = create_room(0, 0, width, height)
    split_recursive(root)

    # 2. Create rooms in leaf nodes
    rooms = []
    for leaf in leaves(root):
        room = create_random_room(leaf)
        rooms.append(room)

    # 3. Connect rooms with corridors
    for i in range(len(rooms) - 1):
        connect_rooms(rooms[i], rooms[i+1])

    return Map(rooms, corridors)
```

### Monster AI (Simple Pathfinding)

```python
# src/core/game.py (simplified)
def monster_turn(state, monster):
    # 1. Can we attack player?
    if adjacent(monster, state.player):
        attack(monster, state.player)
        return

    # 2. Move toward player
    direction = get_direction_to(monster.pos, state.player.pos)
    move(monster, direction)
```

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Turn-Based Gameplay

- **Your turn:** Move, attack, or use item
- **Monster turns:** All monsters move/attack
- **Repeat:** Until you die or win

**Why turn-based?**
- Tactical (think before acting)
- Not twitchy (knowledge > reflexes)
- Classic roguelike feel

### 2. Procedural Generation

Every run is different:
- Random map layout (BSP algorithm)
- Random monster spawns
- Random ore properties (Phase 1)
- Random item drops (Phase 1)

**Replayability:** 1000 runs, 1000 different dungeons

### 3. Permadeath (with meta-progression)

**Permadeath:**
- You die → Run ends → Start over
- No save-scumming

**Meta-progression (Phase 1):**
- Legacy Vault saves rare ore (80+ purity)
- Can withdraw 1 ore per run
- "Pure Victory" (no legacy) vs "Legacy Victory"
- Encourages replay without removing stakes

### 4. Mining/Crafting (Phase 1 - COMPLETE)

**The hook that makes Veinborn unique:**

**Mining:**
- Ore veins in walls (`◆` tiles)
- Survey to see properties (1 turn)
- Mine to collect (3-5 turns, vulnerable!)
- Risk: Mine now (dangerous) or later (safer)?

**Ore Properties (0-100):**
```
Hardness      → Weapon damage / Armor defense
Conductivity  → Magic power / Spell efficiency
Malleability  → Durability / Repair ease
Purity        → Quality multiplier (affects all)
Density       → Weight / Encumbrance
```

**Crafting:**
```
Ore Properties × Recipe × Class Bonus = Final Stats

Example:
  Iron Ore: Hardness 78, Purity 82
  Recipe: Longsword (base +4 damage)

  Damage = 4 + (78 × 0.82) = +68 damage sword!
```

**Why this is fun:**
- Resource hunting ("find that 95+ hardness iron!")
- Meaningful decisions (mine risky ore or keep searching?)
- Dopamine hit from perfect spawns
- Every run has different ore quality

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Read the design:** `docs/VEINBORN_CONSOLIDATED_DESIGN.md`
2. **Check the roadmap:** `docs/MVP_ROADMAP.md`
3. **Understand existing code:** Read `src/core/game.py`, `entities.py`, `world.py`
4. **Implement:** Follow existing patterns
5. **Test:** Play the game, make sure it works
6. **Document:** Update relevant docs

### Code Style

- **Python 3.10+** with type hints
- **Follow existing patterns** (look at `src/core/game.py`)
- **Keep it simple** (no over-engineering)
- **Comment complex logic** (especially algorithms)
- **Write tests** for new systems (see `tests/`)

### Testing Strategy

**Manual testing (primary):**
- Run the game (`python3 run_textual.py`)
- Test your feature by playing
- Try edge cases (what if player dies while mining?)
- Check message log for errors

**Automated testing (secondary):**
- Unit tests in `tests/`
- Run with `python3 -m pytest tests/`
- Test game logic, not UI

### Git Workflow

**Branches:**
- `master` - Working game (always playable)
- Feature branches for new work

**Commits:**
- Descriptive messages ("Add ore vein spawning")
- Atomic commits (one feature per commit)
- Test before committing

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Why Python and not Rust/C++?

**A:** Speed of development > raw performance
- Python is fast enough for turn-based game
- Rich ecosystem (Textual, Pydantic, NATS)
- Async/await for multiplayer (Phase 2)
- Type hints give us safety

### Q: Why Textual framework?

**A:** Best terminal UI framework for Python
- Modern (better than curses/Blessed)
- Widget composition (like React)
- Good documentation
- Active development
- See: `docs/UI_FRAMEWORK.md`

### Q: What's in docs/Archive/?

**A:** ❌ **Don't read it!** Wrong design visions.
- Emotional story progression (rejected)
- 15 essence types (too complex)
- 12-property materials (too much)

**Consolidated design (Oct 22):** Merged 3 visions into current design
- Archive = dead ends
- Read `VEINBORN_CONSOLIDATED_DESIGN.md` instead

### Q: What's the multiplayer status?

**A:** Experimental. WebSocket server, session management, and co-op turn system all exist and mostly work. The 2026-04-17 audit repaired several contract bugs (see `docs/PROJECT_REVIEW_2026-04-17.md`). Remaining work: fix 4 reconnection cleanup tests and 2 websocket timeout tests, validate a 30+ min co-op session end-to-end.

### Q: How can I contribute?

**A:** Pick a task from `docs/MVP_ROADMAP.md`!
- Week 1-2: Mining system
- Week 3: Crafting system
- Week 4: Meta-progression
- Week 5-6: Content & polish
