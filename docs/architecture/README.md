# Veinborn Architecture Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-17
**Current Phase:** Single-player feature-complete; multiplayer experimental

> ⚠️ **Stale references ahead.** References below to `/docs/future-multiplayer/` are defunct — that directory was archived to `~/Archive/veinborn/docs-archive-2026-01-13/` (machine-local, not in this repo). The current, in-repo multiplayer design lives at **`docs/design/MULTIPLAYER_DESIGN_2025.md`**. When following a `/docs/future-multiplayer/...` link, use that file instead. See `docs/PROJECT_REVIEW_2026-04-17.md` for the full audit.

These docs were moved because they're for Phase 2 (multiplayer):

| Document | New Location | Why Moved |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md | `/docs/future-multiplayer/` | NATS, PostgreSQL, microservices (Phase 2) |
| LOGGING_OBSERVABILITY.md | `/docs/future-multiplayer/` | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Phase 2) |
| MESSAGING_ARCHITECTURE.md | `/docs/future-multiplayer/` | NATS, microservices (Phase 2) |

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ DON'T: Implement full architecture from BASE_CLASS_ARCHITECTURE.md

**Problem:** The doc shows event-driven, message-based patterns.

**For MVP:** Use simpler version:
- Simple base classes (Entity, maybe Action)
- Direct function calls (not events)
- No NATS, no event bus, no Lua

**When to use full version:** Phase 2 refactor (8-12 weeks out)

### ❌ DON'T: Spend too much time on LUA_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md

**Problem:** It's 25KB of Phase 3 planning.

**For MVP:** Just be aware:
1. Use YAML for content (not hardcoded)
2. Keep interfaces clean (makes Lua easier later)

**When to implement Lua:** Phase 3 (after multiplayer)

### ❌ DON'T: Implement Phase 2 infrastructure

**Problem:** Phase 2 docs (now in `/docs/future-multiplayer/`) describe NATS, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, Grafana.

**For MVP:** Use simple approaches from `MVP_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`:
```python
# Simple logging
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Player mined ore: %s", ore.ore_type)
```

**When to add infrastructure:** Phase 2 (distributed systems)

### ❌ DON'T: Read docs in `/docs/future-multiplayer/` too much

**Problem:** Tempting to implement Phase 2 architecture.

**For MVP:** Stay focused on simple game loop.

**When to read:** After MVP is complete and fun

## Questions?

### "Which docs should I read for MVP?"

**Essential (must read):**
1. `00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` - How MVP works
2. `MVP_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` - Code style, standards, and advanced practices
3. `MVP_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing approach
4. **`EVENTS_ASYNC_OBSERVABILITY_GUIDE.md` - Events, async/await, telemetry (READ BEFORE CODING!)**
5. `/docs/MVP_ROADMAP.md` - What to build
6. `/docs/MVP_CURRENT_FOCUS.md` - Implementation hub

**Optional (read if interested):**
- `BASE_CLASS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Clean patterns (MVP sections only)
- `CONTENT_SYSTEM.md` - YAML content
- `USING_TIA_AST.md` - Code quality automation
- `ARCHITECTURAL_ASSESSMENT.md` - Architectural analysis and design decisions
- `RANDOMNESS_ANALYSIS.md` - RNG design (no seeding system currently)

**Skip for now:**
- Everything in `/docs/future-multiplayer/` (Phase 2)
- Most of `LUA_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md` (Phase 3)

### "Should I implement Entity base class?"

**Optional, but recommended:**

**Benefits:**
- Less code duplication (Player, Monster, OreVein share code)
- Cleaner architecture
- Easier Phase 2 refactor

**Cost:** 2-3 hours to implement

**Verdict:** Do it in Week 1 if you have time, or Week 3 during cleanup.

**See:** `BASE_CLASS_ARCHITECTURE.md` for details

### "What's the difference between MVP and Phase 2?"

| Aspect | MVP (Now) | Phase 2 (Future) |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Game mode | Single-player | 4-player co-op |
| Architecture | Simple Python loop | Event-driven, NATS |
| Communication | Function calls | Messages |
| Deployment | Local Python script | Microservices, Podman |
| State | In-memory | Distributed |
| Complexity | Simple | Complex |

**MVP is intentionally simple!** Add complexity in Phase 2 when needed for multiplayer.

## Next Steps

1. **New to project?** → Read `/docs/START_HERE.md`
2. **Ready to implement?** → Read `00_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`
3. **Pick a task?** → Read `/docs/MVP_CURRENT_FOCUS.md`
4. **Start coding?** → Read `/docs/MVP_ROADMAP.md` (Week 1-2 tasks)

**Remember:** MVP = simple Python game, Phase 2 = multiplayer complexity
