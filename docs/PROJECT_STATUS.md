# Veinborn Project Status Report

> ⚠️ **This document is under revalidation (2026-04-17).** Claims below date from 2026-01-13 and are known to be wrong in several places — especially "1063 tests passing / 100%" and "Multiplayer Phase 2 complete." Evidence: `docs/PROJECT_REVIEW_2026-04-17.md`. Current reality: SP core ~802 unit tests pass (2 test-drift failures now fixed); MP has 7+ server test failures plus async hangs, `GameSession` misuses `GameState` instead of `GameContext`, and `WaitAction` module is missing. Read `PROJECT_REVIEW_2026-04-17.md` for authoritative status until this doc is rewritten.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-13 (stale — see banner above)
**Status:** ✅ MVP Complete + Multiplayer Phase 2 Complete + Phase 3 Refactoring In Progress 🎉

---

## Executive Summary

**The Veinborn MVP is feature-complete AND multiplayer Phase 2 is working!** All core single-player systems are implemented and tested, plus 2+ player co-op is functional. The project has:

**Single-Player (Complete):**

- ✅ **All Phase 1 MVP systems complete**: Mining, Crafting, Equipment, Save/Load, Character Classes, Legacy Vault, Lua Events
- ✅ **Content expansion complete** - 19 monster types, 23 recipes (6 legendary)
- ✅ **Game runs successfully** with full Textual UI
- ✅ **Phase 3 architectural refactoring complete** (complexity reduction, helper methods, clean code)

**Multiplayer (Phase 2 Complete - as of 2025-11-14):**

# Run tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Verified Working (2025-11-05)

✅ Game starts successfully
✅ Player spawns in dungeon
✅ 3 goblins spawn
✅ 8 ore veins spawn
✅ Basic forge spawns
✅ Controls respond (movement, combat)
✅ UI renders correctly
✅ All systems load without errors
```

### Known Issues
- None critical identified

## Conclusion

**The Veinborn MVP is feature-complete AND multiplayer Phase 2 is working!** All documented Phase 1 systems are implemented, tested, and PLAYABLE. Multiplayer co-op is functional with 2+ players. The project needs:

1. ✅ **Immediate:** Dual-track testing (single-player balance + multiplayer co-op sessions)
2. ⚠️ **Short-term:** Tutorial system, special rooms, multiplayer polish
3. 📦 **Medium-term:** Content expansion (boss fights, class abilities, more recipes)
4. 🚀 **Long-term:** Multiplayer Phase 4 (persistence, advanced features)

**Recommendation:** Continue dual-track development - polish single-player while testing/refining multiplayer. Both modes are playable and ready for testing.

**Major Achievement:** Went from "multiplayer is 8-12 weeks away" to "multiplayer Phase 2 complete" in parallel with single-player polish!

---

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-13
**Test Suite:** 1063 tests passing (100%, expanded 24% since MVP)
**Codebase:** 114+ Python files, ~17,400+ lines of code
**Multiplayer:** 11 new files, ~2,400 lines (Phase 2 complete)
**Architecture:** Phase 3 refactoring complete (complexity reduction, clean code)
