## 📝 Documentation Quality

⚠️ **Under revalidation.** The 2026-04-17 audit (`PROJECT_REVIEW_2026-04-17.md`) found stale test-count claims, missing file references, outdated controls, and architecture docs still pointing at the non-existent `future-multiplayer/` directory. Trust-restore in progress: key docs updated, architecture pointers still need a consolidation pass.

**Recent updates:**
- 2026-04-17: Trust-restore — fixed pytest asyncio marker, added WaitAction, aligned GameSession with GameContext, fixed chat fixture, updated headline docs with real test numbers

**Happy developing! 🎮🚀**
