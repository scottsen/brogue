## 🎮 1. Install (1 minute)

### From PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install veinborn
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottsen/veinborn
cd veinborn
pip install -e .
```

```

## 🎯 3. Play (3 minutes)

### Essential Controls
- **Move:** Arrow keys or `hjkl` (vim), diagonals `yubn`
- **Attack:** Bump into monsters
- **Mine:** Bump into an ore vein (no key — movement mines automatically)
- **Survey ore:** `s` (scan nearby veins)
- **Pickup:** `g` — **Inventory:** `i` — **Equip/wield:** `w`
- **Look at ground:** `:`
- **Wait/pass turn:** `.` or `space`
- **Descend stairs:** `>`
- **Chat (multiplayer):** `c` or `enter`
- **Save/Load:** `S` / `L` — **Restart:** `r` — **Quit:** `q`

### Quick Tips
1. **Mining is bump-to-mine** — just walk into ore veins
2. **Find forges** — yellow █ symbols on the map (crafting triggers contextually)
3. **Craft weapons** — better gear = easier combat
4. **Legacy Vault** — when you die, rare ore is saved for next run
5. **Experiment** — try all 4 character classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Healer)
